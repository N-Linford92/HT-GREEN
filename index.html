                        <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat 
                        pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a 
                        system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future.</p>

                        <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than 
                        the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution 
                        to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.</p><br>                       
                        <p>Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but 
                        has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate  
                        boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the 
                        range and size of viable resources, especially for direct applications such as  
                        home heating.</p><br>                     
                        <p>Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the  
                        earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels.  
                        As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming 
                        if widely deployed instead of fossil fuels.</p>
